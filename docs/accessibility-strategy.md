## Accessibility Standards

The LOTA Canada website adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards. These guidelines are organized around four principles:

### 1. Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- **Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media
- **Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- **Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content

### 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- **Keyboard Accessible**: Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- **Enough Time**: Provide users enough time to read and use content
- **Seizures and Physical Reactions**: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
- **Navigable**: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are
- **Input Modalities**: Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard

### 3. Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

- **Readable**: Make text content readable and understandable
- **Predictable**: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
- **Input Assistance**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- **Compatible**: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies

## Implementation Strategy

### Design Phase

- Include accessibility requirements in design specifications
- Use accessible color combinations with sufficient contrast
- Design focus states for interactive elements
- Create responsive layouts that work at different zoom levels
- Document accessibility considerations for each component

### Development Phase

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA attributes when HTML semantics are insufficient
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Provide appropriate text alternatives for images and other non-text content
- Implement proper form labels and error handling
- Ensure content is structured logically with proper heading hierarchy

### Content Creation

- Write clear, concise content with simple language
- Use descriptive link text
- Provide transcripts and captions for multimedia content
- Structure content with proper headings and lists
- Avoid using color alone to convey information

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Header Component

- Implement a skip link to bypass navigation
- Ensure dropdown menus are keyboard accessible
- Use `aria-expanded` to indicate dropdown state
- Implement proper focus management for mobile menu
- Use `aria-current` to indicate current page

```jsx
// Skip link implementation
<a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">
  Skip to main content
</a>

// Dropdown menu implementation
<button
  aria-expanded={isOpen}
  aria-controls="dropdown-menu"
  onClick={toggleMenu}
>
  Menu
</button>
<ul id="dropdown-menu" role="menu" hidden={!isOpen}>
  {/* Menu items */}
</ul>
```

### Form Components

- Associate labels with form controls
- Provide clear error messages
- Use `aria-required` for required fields
- Use `aria-invalid` for fields with errors
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate error messages with fields

```jsx
<div>
  <label id="name-label" htmlFor="name">
    Name
  </label>
  <input
    id="name"
    name="name"
    aria-required="true"
    aria-invalid={hasError}
    aria-describedby={hasError ? "name-error" : undefined}
  />
  {hasError && (
    <div id="name-error" role="alert">
      Please enter your name
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

### Interactive Components

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide appropriate ARIA roles and states
- Implement proper focus management for modals and other overlays
- Ensure sufficient touch target size for mobile users

```jsx
// Modal implementation
<div role="dialog" aria-modal="true" aria-labelledby="modal-title">
  <h2 id="modal-title">Modal Title</h2>
  <button onClick={closeModal}>Close</button>
  {/* Modal content */}
</div>
```

### Workflow Components

- Ensure all workflow-related components are keyboard accessible
- Provide appropriate ARIA roles and states for workflow forms
- Implement proper focus management for workflow creation and execution interfaces
- Ensure sufficient touch target size for mobile users

```jsx
// Workflow creation form implementation
<form aria-labelledby="create-workflow-form">
  <h2 id="create-workflow-form">Create Workflow</h2>
  <label htmlFor="workflow-name">Workflow Name</label>
  <input id="workflow-name" name="workflow-name" aria-required="true" />
  <button type="submit">Create</button>
</form>

// Workflow execution form implementation
<form aria-labelledby="execute-workflow-form">
  <h2 id="execute-workflow-form">Execute Workflow</h2>
  <label htmlFor="workflow-id">Workflow ID</label>
  <input id="workflow-id" name="workflow-id" aria-required="true" />
  <button type="submit">Execute</button>
</form>
```

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing

- Implement Jest and Testing Library for component testing
- Use jest-axe for automated accessibility testing
- Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipeline
- Run Lighthouse accessibility audits regularly

```javascript
// Example jest-axe test
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from "jest-axe";
import Component from "./Component";

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test("Component should not have accessibility violations", async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Component />);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

### Manual Testing

- Perform keyboard navigation testing
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Test with browser zoom and text resizing
- Test with high contrast mode
- Test with reduced motion preferences

### User Testing

- Conduct testing with users who have disabilities
- Include users with various assistive technologies
- Document and address feedback from user testing
- Perform regular accessibility audits with expert reviewers

## Continuous Improvement

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regularly review and update accessibility documentation
- Monitor accessibility issues through user feedback
- Perform periodic accessibility audits
- Keep up-to-date with evolving accessibility standards

### Regression Prevention

- Include accessibility checks in code reviews
- Maintain a comprehensive test suite
- Document accessibility requirements for new features
- Provide accessibility training for new team members
