7. **User Satisfaction**: Gauge overall user satisfaction with the website

## Participant Recruitment

### Target User Groups

We will recruit participants from the following user groups:

1. **Primary Users**:

   - LOTA members
   - Potential members
   - Industry professionals

2. **Secondary Users**:

   - General public interested in LOTA's mission
   - Partners and sponsors
   - Media representatives

3. **Accessibility Focus Groups**:
   - Users with visual impairments
   - Users with motor disabilities
   - Users with cognitive disabilities
   - Users who rely on keyboard navigation
   - Users of screen readers and other assistive technologies

### Recruitment Methods

- Email invitations to existing LOTA members
- Social media announcements
- Partner organizations that work with people with disabilities
- Professional recruitment services for specialized participants
- Community bulletin boards and forums

### Sample Size

- 5-8 participants from each primary and secondary user group
- 3-5 participants from each accessibility focus group
- Total target: 25-30 participants

## Testing Methodology

### Testing Approaches

1. **Moderated In-Person Testing**:

   - Conducted at LOTA offices or accessible testing facilities
   - One-on-one sessions with a facilitator
   - Think-aloud protocol to capture user thoughts

2. **Remote Moderated Testing**:

   - Video conferencing with screen sharing
   - Particularly useful for geographically dispersed participants
   - Allows testing in the user's natural environment

3. **Unmoderated Remote Testing**:

   - Using tools like UserTesting or Maze
   - Allows for larger sample sizes
   - Participants complete tasks on their own time

4. **Accessibility-Specific Testing**:
   - Specialized testing with assistive technology users
   - Focused on WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - May require specialized facilitators

### Testing Environment

- **Devices**: Desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Assistive Technologies**: Screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver), screen magnifiers, voice recognition software
- **Connection Speeds**: Test on various connection speeds to simulate different user conditions

## Test Scenarios
