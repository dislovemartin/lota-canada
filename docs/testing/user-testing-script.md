# LOTA Canada Contact Form User Testing Script

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in this user testing session. Today we'll be testing the contact form on the LOTA Canada website. This test will take approximately 15-20 minutes.

My name is [Facilitator Name], and I'll be guiding you through this session. Before we begin, I'd like to share a few things to keep in mind:

- This is a test of the website, not of you. There are no right or wrong answers.
- Please think aloud as you navigate through the tasks. Share your thoughts, questions, and any confusion you might experience.
- We're looking for your honest feedback to improve the website.
- If you have any questions during the test, feel free to ask, but I may not answer immediately as we want to see how you would naturally interact with the site.

Do you have any questions before we begin?
