This directory contains images used throughout the LOTA website.

## Image Organization

- `/brand/` - Logo and brand assets

- `/leadership/` - Leadership-related images
- `/networking/` - Networking-related images
- `/mentorship/` - Mentorship-related images
- `/project-management/` - Project management and avatar images

## Image Sources

All images are either:

1. Owned by LOTA
2. Licensed from stock photo services
3. Free-to-use images from Unsplash and other free sources

## Using Images

When using images in the codebase:

1. Use the appropriate image for the context
2. Avoid duplicate images across different sections
3. Use the `ProfessionalImage` or `OptimizedImage` components when possible
4. Provide meaningful alt text for accessibility
5. Consider using the image fallbacks from `lib/image-fallbacks.ts`

## Adding New Images

To add new images:

1. Place them in the appropriate directory
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Optimize images for web (compress, resize)
4. Update the image fallbacks in `lib/image-fallbacks.ts` if needed
5. Document the source and license if from external sources

## Downloading New Images

You can use the `scripts/download-images.sh` script to download new high-quality images from Unsplash and other free sources.

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/download-images.sh

# Run the script
./scripts/download-images.sh
```

The script will download images to the `/public/images/hero/new/` directory. You can then update the image paths in the code to use these new images.
