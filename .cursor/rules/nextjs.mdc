## Next.js 15 Architecture
- **Use the App Router (app/)** for all new development.
- **Leverage React Server Components (RSC)** for optimal performance.
- **Minimize use client usage** â€“ only for interactive elements like forms, animations, and UI state.
- **Use React Suspense** for lazy loading.
- **Optimize API calls using Server Actions** instead of client-side fetching.
- **Use next-safe-action for server actions with validation.**
- **Handle errors properly**:
  - Expected errors: Return typed errors from server actions.
  - Unexpected errors: Use error.tsx and global-error.tsx.
- **Prefer useActionState with react-hook-form** for form management.

## Performance Optimization
- Use **lazy loading** for non-critical components (next/dynamic).
- Optimize **Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)**.
- Use **optimized images (next/image)** with WebP and AVIF formats.
- Implement **code splitting and tree shaking**.
- Avoid unnecessary useEffect and prefer **React Server Components**.
